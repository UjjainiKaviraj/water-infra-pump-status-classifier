# water-infra-pump-status-classifier
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the operational status of rural water pumps based on various physical, geographical, and socio-economic attributes. This includes determining whether a pump is functional (coded as 1) or non-functional (coded as 0). By analyzing features such as the pumpâ€™s age, installation year, source type, payment model, and more, the aim is to identify patterns that influence functionality. This prediction model can then be used to optimize maintenance schedules and improve resource allocation.
This project focuses on predicting the operational status of water pumps using data mining techniques. By leveraging real-world water infrastructure data, we apply classification models to predict whether a pump is functional or not. The project involved cleaning, transforming, and exploring the data followed by building several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Voting Ensemble
